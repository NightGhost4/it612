# React Three Components – CodeSandbox Assignment

This project meets the requirements for the CodeSandbox React assignment (three components, three locations, labels, and `styles.css` with at least three CSS rules).

## Part A – Use in CodeSandbox

1. Go to [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io) and sign in (or create an account).
2. Create a new sandbox: **New** → **From a template** → **React**.
3. Replace the default files with the contents of this project:
   - Copy `src/App.js`, `src/Name.js`, `src/List.js`, `src/Button.js`, `src/styles.css`, and `src/index.js` into the same paths in your sandbox.
   - If your template uses `index.html` in `public/`, use this project’s `public/index.html` there.
   - If the template has different `package.json` scripts, you can keep them; the app only needs React and React DOM.
4. Run the app and check the preview pane.

**Before submitting:** In `src/Name.js`, replace `"YourFirstName"` and `"YourLastName"` with your real first and last name.

## Part B – What’s in the app

- **Three components:** `Name`, `List`, `Button`.
- **Three locations:** Top (Location 1), middle (Location 2), bottom (Location 3), each with visible labels.
- **Name component:** Shows first and last name (edit in `Name.js`).
- **List component:** Renders an unordered list (`<ul>`) with several items.
- **Button component:** A button that updates a click count when clicked.

## Part C – CSS

`styles.css` includes at least three distinct rules (e.g. `.section`, `.label`, `.action-button`) so the sections, labels, and button are clearly styled.

## Part D – Submission

1. In CodeSandbox, click **Share**.
2. Set the sandbox to **Public** or **Unlisted**.
3. Copy the **Sandbox Link (URL)**.
4. Submit that URL in My Courses.
